Maybe Rome Had It Coming
Matthew P. Gordon

Maybe Rome had it coming
Maybe Nero figured there wasn't anything left he could do to help.
Maybe he loved playing the fiddle
And feared this might be his last chance
Maybe Rome had it coming
And Nero
Bursting with love for mankind
Wanted to leave the world with a song
And not a sigh
